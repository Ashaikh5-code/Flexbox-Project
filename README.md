# Flexbox-Project

## Overview

This project is a practice exercise for creating a web page using Flexbox. The goal is to replicate the given design images using HTML and CSS. The web page consists of 4 main sections and a footer.

## Instructions

1. **Commit Early & Often**
   - Regularly commit your changes with meaningful commit messages. You can reference the Commit Message lesson [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/commit-messages).

2. **Design Images**
   - Download the design images and take a look at what youâ€™re going to be creating:
     - [Image One (Full Design)](path/to/Image-One.png)
     - [Image Two (Color and Fonts)](path/to/Image-Two.png)

3. **Font**
   - The font used in the images is Roboto. You can include it in your project using the following link in your HTML `<head>`:
     ```html
     <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
     ```

4. **Hero Text**
   - Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.

5. **Project Approach**
   - Take it one section at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed.
   - The website has 4 main sections and a footer. Start at the top and get each section in pretty good shape before moving on to the next.
   - Begin by getting all the content onto the page with HTML before starting to style it with CSS. This approach will save time and reduce frustration.

6. **Styling**
   - You can use one CSS file for this project.
   - Many elements on this page are similar to those in the flexbox exercises. Refer back to those exercises if needed.

7. **Mobile Design**
   - Do not worry about making the project look nice on a mobile device. Mobile design will be covered later.

8. **Pushing to GitHub**
   - When you finish, push your project to GitHub.
